So while reading this up, I found the below image, which basically states - that if we enrich our contact information from indirect sources like public directories, the internet, etc., we need to notify them within a month.\n\nNot feeling very confident about the feasibility of this, was wondering if anyone has worked around GDPR compliant policies and knows the operational aspect of it.\nWould appreciate any input."
