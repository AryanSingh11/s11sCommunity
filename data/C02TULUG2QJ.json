But I'm learning many things.\n\nBut in LinkedIn I just saw a web3 company wants to hire a person with same skillsets. They're ready to offer 12LPA fixed+variable+offsite+tech equipment from the company. All the skillsets are matching with me & I can show them the result of what values I can add in their company. \n\nSo, it's a very easy option to switch. Like around 300% hike is HUGEEE. But in my present job, I'm learning very much & I've a very good relationship with the founder. Also I'm the 1st employee here. Hopefully there are some future benefits too:)\n\nPlease guide, what I can do?"

I have given interviews for digital marketing role for around 5-10 companies and the experience has been more or less same and sometimes underwhelming.\n\nA couple of companies that stood out were Wingman and Springworks. The person who interviewed me at Wingman sent across material on request and was responsive via LI and email helping me with most of my doubts. Sprigworks the entire process was seamless and helpful. We need more companies like this that leave a good taste even if you aren't getting selected. I personally wish both these companies reach great heights such was the experience.",

I have given interviews for digital marketing role for around 5-10 companies and the experience has been more or less same and sometimes underwhelming.\n\nA couple of companies that stood out were Wingman and Springworks. The person who interviewed me at Wingman sent across material on request and was responsive via LI and email helping me with most of my doubts. Sprigworks the entire process was seamless and helpful. We need more companies like this that leave a good taste even if you aren't getting selected. I personally wish both these companies reach great heights such was the experience."

The reason: Past 3 companies I have worked with were start-up's, and the close collaboration b/w Sales &amp; Marketing made me realise my knack for overall GTM planning (I don't like sales anymore...help me please!!). The problem: I have zero clue on where to and how to begin with this. I have 3 questions:\n1. Where do I begin? (Currently on LinkedIn Learning courses on PMM, but if there's something else, I'd be thankful for your suggestions)\n2. Since I am working in Sales, I am earning approx. 30LPA (60-40 split). If I get an opp in PMM in the future, what's the pay that I can expect (high/low/none/wishful thinking)?\n3. In the current space, any suggestions on the orgs I should keep an eye out for, for any opps? (out of curiosity)\nThanks in advance\n\nPS: I am comfortable with responses in any language... desperate for guidance, and I will use Google Translate if needed :D",
