I'm not a data engineer, analyst, or scientist, but have had the chance to work with data extensively and now I'm working on bridging the widening gap between data people and non-data people.\n\nI had created Data-led Academy to foster data literacy amongst product and growth professionals and recently <https://amplitude.com/blog/data-led-academy|sold it to Amplitude>. I'm now building <https://ask.astorik.com/|astorik> where anyone can get expert, unbiased, and actionable answers to their data questions, directly from practitioners or vendors.\n\nI typically find myself spending my days thinking, writing in simple terms, hanging out in communities, and answering people's questions -- if you have questions about customer data infrastructure (CDI, CDP, ELT, Reverse ETL, etc), <https://ask.astorik.com/c/ask-arpit-choudhury/|I'm here> to answer them.\n\nFun fact: I've only worked at an office for 9 months in 9+ years of working!\n\n:beers:",
