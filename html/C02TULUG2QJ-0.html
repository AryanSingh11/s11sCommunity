Look at it directionally.<br>‚Ä¢ Companies come in all shapes and sizes. Hence, the "leadership" can mean different things depending on the size, growth rate, leader experience, funding raised etc. This data has not been normalized for all those factors.<br>‚Ä¢ In many companies, a reportee CAN and does make more than the manager. Just being a manager does not make you more valuable than your reportees (just like in Cricket, the captain may or may not be the best player. Captaincy requires different skills. You'll find this true in many high-performing engineering teams where the rockstar engineer would hate to carry on managerial work as they would rather solve interesting/challening technical problems than deal with imperfect humans). In marketing, this is especially true with somewhat technical skills (ops, performance, brand), which are otherwise rare to find. Not to mention some sales reps may also make more than their managers.</div></div></div><div class="message-gutter" id="1648699985.918559"><div class="" data-stringify-ignore="true"></div><div class=""><span class="sender"></span><span class="timestamp"><span class="c-timestamp__label">Thursday, March 31st, 2022 at 9:43:05 AM GMT+05:30</span></span><br/><div class="text">when are we as a society going to stop the phenomenon that is Starbucks interviews</div></div></div><div class="message-gutter" id="1648702995.718359"><div class="" data-stringify-ignore="true"></div><div class=""><span class="sender"></span><span class="timestamp"><span class="c-timestamp__label">Thursday, March 31st, 2022 at 10:33:15 AM GMT+05:30</span></span><br/><div class="text">is it okay to ask the salary range before you jump on a call with recruiter?

Would be great if I could have your experienced advice:<br><br>I have been working in Sales for the past 8 years, and want to transition to PMM (or Strategy) Role. The reason: Past 3 companies I have worked with were start-up's, and the close collaboration b/w Sales &amp; Marketing made me realise my knack for overall GTM planning (I don't like sales anymore...help me please!!). The problem: I have zero clue on where to and how to begin with this. I have 3 questions:<br>1. Where do I begin? (Currently on LinkedIn Learning courses on PMM, but if there's something else, I'd be thankful for your suggestions)<br>2. Since I am working in Sales, I am earning approx. 30LPA (60-40 split). If I get an opp in PMM in the future, what's the pay that I can expect (high/low/none/wishful thinking)?<br>3. In the current space, any suggestions on the orgs I should keep an eye out for, for any opps? (out of curiosity)<br>Thanks in advance<br><br>PS: I am comfortable with responses in any language... desperate for guidance, and I will use Google Translate if needed :D</div></div></div><div class="message-gutter" id="1649761280.433259"><div class="" data-stringify-ignore="true"></div><div class=""><span class="sender"></span><span class="timestamp"><span class="c-timestamp__label">Tuesday, April 12th, 2022 at 4:31:20 PM GMT+05:30</span></span><br/><div class="text">I am very new to company only 3 months and function as well so many times i make mistake and get it rectified by manager.many times I made silly mistake got scolded like really harsh.<br>Does this mistake as a consequence can get me fired.<br>Should i apply for other company hand by hand or else this is something everybody faces?</div></div></div><div class="message-gutter" id="1649761854.257399"><div class="" data-stringify-ignore="true"></div><div class=""><span class="sender"></span><span class="timestamp"><span class="c-timestamp__label">Tuesday, April 12th, 2022 at 4:40:54 PM GMT+05:30</span></span><br/><div class="text">&gt;
